## What is JSX and how does react interpret it?

JSX is an extension of javascript which works as syntactic sugar in react components. It’s like a template language but it has the full power of javascript. JSX produces react elements, but react doesn’t require using JSX.

After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects. Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.
