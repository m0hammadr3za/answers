## Why we use caching? Give some examples of caching in the web.

Chasing means storing frequently demanded data to increase the access speed. Cash is used by many different tools like web browsers, web servers, databases andâ€¦

One simple example of caching is when a user visits a website. On the first visit, the browser needs to download all required files and data. But on subsequent requests when files and some data have been cashed the browser can access them directly from the user's device instead of redownloading them, therefore the page will load much faster.

One other use case of casing can be implemented on the server to store frequently queried data. This will save extra network calls. We can also use cashing on the server to avoid recomputation or reduce db load.
